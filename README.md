# Rate The Relevance Of A Search Result.

## Overview In this task, we need your help determining to what extent
a search result matches the search query that it is paired with. Your
job is to use the rules we provide to judge how well each result
matches the query intent. All of the items are related to home and
garden products.

## We Provide
- A Search Query
  - This is the actual search term that a user has put into a search engine.
- Product Title
  -The title of the product that was returned for the search query.
- Product Image
  - The image of the product that was returned for the search query.
- For some products, we will also provide a Product URL, where you can
  view more information about the result.

## Process
1. All search terms and result are related to home improvement,
   gardening, construction and do-it-yourself projects. Your job is to
   understand the *intent and relevancy* of the search query. This task
   is *not* about your opinions of the relevancy of these items.
2. Examine the Product Description. Do not only use the product title
to determine relevancy.
    - Focus on the following attributes when comparing the product to
the query. e.g. Brand, Material, and Functionality. **IMPORTANT**: Brand is
as important as the Functionality!
3. For each query/result pair, *compare* the query with the product
title and image.
    - Try to understand the intent for making the search query. What
      do you think the person was looking for? Do you think the
      product satisfies the intent of this search?

Decide how relevant each product is to the query using these ratings:
    - Irrelevant (1)
    - Partially or somewhat relevant (2)
    - Perfect match (3)

## Tips and Examples

### Do This:
    - Review the information we've provided before making your decision.
    - Use the guidelines provided below to determine relevancy. This
      is a rules based relevancy task, not opinion based.
    - Remember that the products are related to home improvement,
      gardening, construction and do-it-yourself projects.


### Choose Perfect Match if:
    - The result matches the query intent perfectly.
    - The searched product is a part of a kit or included as a part or an item in the product shown.
    - The product is exactly what the customer was most likely trying to find.
    - The query was for a brand and the result is made by that brand.

### Choose Partially or somewhat relevant if:
    - The result generally matches the query, but there is ambiguity
      in either search terms or product details that prevents you from
      choosing 'Perfect Match.'
    - Actual product is the same but differs in
      brand, dimensions, color or specifications.
    - Product specifications are not clear or product is a somewhat
      ambiguousÂ synonym of the search term.
    - One of the many products searched in the query are
      shown. (example: when searching for washer & dryer, only washer
      is shown)

### Choose Irrelevant: Paired with Search by Mistake if:
    - The result is not at all related to the intent of the search term.
    - The result is an item that is used with search term such as tool, accessory, extra part, cover or case.
    - The result has a completely different meaning, even if there are words in common with the search term.
    - The result is a collection of items and the search term does not appear in the set.

### Do Not:
    - Assume you know whether the result matches the query before
      sufficiently examining the information provided.
    - Use only the words in the query and result to determine
      relevancy. This task is about intent, not word matching.
